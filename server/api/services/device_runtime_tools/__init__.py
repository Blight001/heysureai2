"""Factory-default desktop runtime tools, shipped as standalone .py bodies.

These are the read-only "出厂默认" set. On first use they are seeded into each
user's workspace (``<workspace>/device_tools/desktop/``) where they become the
editable source of truth — the AI manages them as files via MCP, not the DB.

Each tool is one ``bodies/<name>.py`` (the python body, using injected ``args``
and assigning ``result``) plus an entry in ``definitions.json`` (metadata:
name / description / input_schema / permissions). All defaults are
``runtime=python``.
