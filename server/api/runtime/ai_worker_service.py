"""``ai-runtime`` worker pool — consume chat runs from the queue.

The dispatcher is dialect-aware:
- **Postgres**: a single LISTEN connection waits on the ``ai_run_queued``
  channel. Each NOTIFY wakes the dispatcher, which then claims one row via
  ``SELECT … FROM chatrun WHERE status='queued' ORDER BY id FOR UPDATE
  SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1``. Multiple ai-runtime instances can run side by
  side and the database arbitrates fairly.
- **SQLite**: polling fallback, since SQLite has neither LISTEN/NOTIFY
  nor real row-level locking. Only one ai-runtime instance is supported
  in this mode.

In both cases the actual heavy lifting is delegated to ``_run_worker``
exactly like the monolith thread does today; the worker just runs it in
a dedicated thread per claimed run and the dispatcher loops back for the
next NOTIFY.
