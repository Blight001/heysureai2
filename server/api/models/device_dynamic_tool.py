"""Web-authored dynamic MCP tools, scoped by device type.

The device shells (Linux / Windows desktop + browser extension) already ship a
"dynamic MCP" interpreter: JSON programs (``call`` / ``set`` / ``return``
instructions) that can be hot-loaded without recompiling the client and may
wrap built-in primitives via ``builtin:<name>``. Until now those definitions
lived only on the device (authored by the AI through
``mcp.manage_dynamic_tool``).

This table inverts the source of truth: an operator authors dynamic tools in
the web console, the server stores them here keyed by ``(user_id,
device_type, name)``, and pushes the enabled set down to every online device of
that type (``device:tool-config``). The device merges them into its dynamic
interpreter and re-reports its tool catalog, so the rest of the endpoint
pipeline (presence snapshot, per-agent scope, dispatch) keeps working unchanged.

``device_type`` is ``"desktop"`` or ``"browser"`` — every device of that kind
owned by the user shares the same dynamic tool set, so a tool change ships to
all of them at once and the client never needs a new release for it.
